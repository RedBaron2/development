    <description>##What is "Tron Script"?
Tron is a script that "fights for the User". It's basically a glorified collection of Windows batch files that automate a bunch of scanning/disinfection/cleanup tools on a Windows system. I got tired of running the utilities manually and decided to just automate everything. I hope this helps other techs, admins, and users in general.

Tron's goal is to take a badly-running Windows system (bloated, infected, etc) and automate ~85% of the work involved in disinfecting it, removing bloatware, and basically cleaning everything up to get it running well again. That's pretty much it. At this point it seems to accomplish that goal pretty well on most systems.

The whole project is built with heavy reliance on community input and updated regularly.</description>
