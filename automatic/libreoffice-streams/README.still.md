LibreOffice is the free power-packed Open Source personal productivity suite for Windows, macOS and Linux, that gives you six feature-rich applications for all your document production and data processing needs.

## Notes

- This package installs LibreOffice Still which is the stable version of LibreOffice that has undergone more testing (over a longer time). This version is recommended for more conservative users or for deployments in enterprise or corporate environments. If you want the latest version with the most recent bleeding-edge features, install [libreoffice-fresh](/packages/libreoffice-fresh) instead.
- For business deployments, The Document Foundation (the foundation behind the LibreOffice project) strongly recommends [support from certified partners](https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/professional-support/) which also offer long-term support versions of LibreOffice.
- Older versions of this package are likely broken because the LibreOffice team removes the download links for older versions after each update.
